# Patterns of diversity across the mouse genome

**Apologies, I am resolving some IT issues to get access to a server to sync the files with the repo. I'll update this part of the repo once I have can access the relevant server.**

In the mean time, all the datafiles are deposited here. The taxa and recombination map info are given in the file names. For example, ```exons/Mmc.coxDistance.csv``` contains data diversity in *Mus musculus castaneus* around protein-coding exons, with distances calculated using the Cox et al (2009) genetic map for mice.
